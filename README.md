#### This aplication utilises OpenAi davinci-002

## Description
Become a creative writer with just a couple words! The Ai will use your prompts and make a scary and
spooky short story. No typing necessary.

## Instructions
- Click the button at the bottom of the text area
- Say two or three words
- Wait for the ai to respond

### Problems 
original prompts used from documentation caused unwanted responses that did not relate to the
prompts generated by voice. After adjusting the parameters of the Ai, it began responding as we liked.

#### Warning
The Ai scrapes data across the internet to create a horror story, occasionally the 
Ai may respond in an inappropriate manner in which I apologise for any offense caused 

#### Initial application
This web application was initially made in 24 hours for a hackathon at Brainstation Bootcamp. 

All edits are done after 14/10/2022 are done by Omar Mahmoud and not for the Hackathon
